  STOCH_K_SMOOTH: 5,       // K smoothing
  STOCH_D_PERIOD: 5,       // D period
  OVERSOLD_LEVEL: 20,      // Oversold threshold
  DAYS_TO_FETCH: 100,      // Historical data days
  BATCH_SIZE: 10,          // Batch processing size
  WAIT_TIME: 500,          // Delay between requests (ms)
};
```

## Technical Details

### Stochastic Oscillator Calculation

The bot uses the standard Stochastic Oscillator formula:

1. **Raw %K** = ((Current Close - Lowest Low) / (Highest High - Lowest Low)) √ó 100
2. **Smoothed %K** = SMA of Raw %K over K_Smooth period
3. **%D** = SMA of Smoothed %K over D period

### Data Source

- Uses Yahoo Finance API for real-time IDX stock data
- Automatically adds `.JK` suffix for Indonesian stocks
- Fetches up to 100 days of historical data

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding
- Check if bot token is correct in Railway variables
- Verify deployment logs in Railway dashboard
- Ensure bot is running (look for "ü§ñ Bot is running..." in logs)

### "No data available" errors
- Stock symbol might be delisted or invalid
- Try another stock or sector
- Check Yahoo Finance directly to verify stock exists

### Rate limiting
- Increase `WAIT_TIME` in CONFIG if getting errors
- Process smaller sectors first
- Yahoo Finance has rate limits (usually sufficient for normal use)

### Railway deployment issues
- Check build logs for errors
- Ensure `package.json` has correct start script
- Verify Node.js version compatibility (18+)

## Cost & Limits

### Railway Free Tier
- 500 hours/month of runtime (enough for 24/7 with room to spare)
- $5 free credit per month
- No credit card required for basic use

### Bot Limits
- No limit on number of users
- Rate limiting depends on data source (Yahoo Finance)
- Recommended: Add delays between large sector screens

## Development

### Run in Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

This uses `nodemon` to auto-restart on file changes.

### Testing Individual Functions
```javascript
// Test single stock
/stock BBCA

// Test sector screening (start with small sector)
/screen
// Then select "Utilities" (12 stocks)
```

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` file to GitHub
- Keep your bot token secret
- Use Railway's environment variables for production
- The `.gitignore` file prevents accidental token commits

## Support & Updates

For issues or questions:
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Verify bot token is correct
3. Test with `/stock BBCA` command first
4. Try smaller sectors before large ones
